Hi {Company_Name} team,

I just saw your posting on AngelList for a development position and was wondering if you have any internship/coop openings available? (May to August)

I have about ~1 year of experience developing applications using technologies like Ruby on Rails, React, and ASP.NET.

If you'd like to chat please refer to my email on my resume @http://tinyurl.com/zv4458n
Cheers,

Andy

Hi Magnet Forensics team,

I actually first heard of Magnet Forensics at Communitech at Waterloo Hacks and I think we would be a good fit. I am always finding different ways to approach development and continuously polish my skillset by working on projects in a wide variety of different technologies outside of class.



Cheers,

Andy
