# Bookbub Coding Challenge:
Done using Node.js

# Getting Started
On a machine installed with Node.js
In the project directory
`npm install`
`node app.js`

# Time Spent
Timeboxed for 2 hours

# Considerations & Tradeoffs
Invalid input is an issue, what if we have two keywords for the same genre which value should we use?

# If given more time
- Develop Unit tests
- Error handling, (bad input should end program gracefully)
- Not hardcoding the input files, add it as a parameter for the Classifer
- A proper printer for the results
