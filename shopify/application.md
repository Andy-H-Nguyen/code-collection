You know, my previous DevOps lead said that Infrastructure engineering is like building a bridge. Design it well, and you hold several hundred cars. If not, it comes all crashing down. Well, I want to prevent that

During the Game of Knowns, I thought it would be cool to build a web or mobile app for the game. Building a web application (using Rails) would be an excellent way to avoid the limitations of having the game of the powerpoint by creating new features like scoreboards! 

Hi  J-Lo (=^-Ï‰-^=),

I am excited about potentially joining the team at Shopify. I've been to the info session and I am excited that everyone has varied interests and I am excited for the future exchanges that will happen. I personally am a huge audio nerd, I have previously built my own DIY vacuum tube amps (Yeah those OLD things from the 70s) and digital-analog converters from open source designs. 

I also love programming, I attend hackathons, I maintain an active Github and I love work on personal projects. I am constantly learning new technologies. Right now, I am learning HTML5 game programming and made projects in which I learn more and more with each one I make, please check out what I make:

Thanks for reading Shopify team!

Andy
