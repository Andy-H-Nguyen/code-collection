Hi Ubisoft team,

I've been coding since I was in middle school by creating games. That is why Ubisoft would be my dream company to work at.  Since then, I have been coding alot and much of what I am working on goes on my Github. (Checkout @ahng1996).

At my previous companies as a co-op, I architectured the backend of a feature and worked with UI/UX and frontend developers to develop and launch the feature for the closed beta. 

Thanks for reading! If you want to chat please reach me at andy.h.nguyen1996@gmail.com
